# How I completed this project?

1. I wrote a test that loops through each feed in the `allFeeds` object and ensures it has a URL defined and that the URL is not empty.
2. I wrote a test that loops through each feed in the `allFeeds` object and ensures it has a name defined and that the name is not empty.
3. I wrote a new test suite named `"The menu"`.
4. I Wrote a test that ensures the menu element is hidden by default. You'll have to analyze the HTML and the CSS to determine how we're performing the hiding/showing of the menu element.
5. I Wrote a test that ensures the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked. This test should have two expectations: does the menu display when clicked and does it hide when clicked again.
6. I Wrote a test suite named `"Initial Entries"`.
7. I Wrote a test that ensures when the `loadFeed` function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single `.entry` element within the `.feed` container.
8. I Wrote a test suite named `"New Feed Selection"`.
9. I Wrote a test that ensures when a new feed is loaded by the `loadFeed` function that the content actually changes.
